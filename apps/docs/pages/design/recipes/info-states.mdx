Info States display impactful information about the status or the outcome of different app processes. In some contexts, they may even interrupt the experience requiring user input.

## Usage

The Info States can display a wide variety of content. Thanks to their impactful visual, they are particularly useful in:

- creating **empty states**
- announcing the **start** or the **completion** of a process
- showing a **waiting message** or an **in-line error**
- celebrating an **achievement**

<Stack rowGap={24}>
  <Stack direction="row" columnGap={24}>
    <ThemedImg src="/design/recipes/info-states/example-1.png" />
    <ThemedImg src="/design/recipes/info-states/example-3.png" />
  </Stack>
  <Stack direction="row" columnGap={24}>
    <ThemedImg src="/design/recipes/info-states/example-2.png" />
    <ThemedImg src="/design/recipes/info-states/example-4.png" />
  </Stack>
</Stack>

## Images and icons

The illustration and the icon support the tagline, by visually conveying the purpose of the screen.

According to the context, the illustration can have a neutral or a humorous tone. Images that express a sense of urgency should be avoided.

<Stack direction="row" columnGap={24}>
  <HintCard isBad image="/design/recipes/info-states/image-dont.png" />
  <HintCard image="/design/recipes/info-states/image-do.png" />
</Stack>

## Tagline and text

The tagline and the text should be designed to clearly express the information involved in the process they refer to, giving the user the specific details that he needs.

Since the tagline is the prominent message, try to keep it helpful and succinct, not exceeding two rows of text. Take advantage of the optional text if you need to give the user further information.

<Stack direction="row" columnGap={24}>
  <HintCard isBad image="/design/recipes/info-states/tagline-dont.png" />
  <HintCard image="/design/recipes/info-states/tagline-do.png" />
</Stack>

## Actions

The Info State's embedded actions let the user either take action on a process performed by the app or navigate to a different screen.

## Placement

Info States should be placed to create balance with the other elements of the interface. It is highly recommended to center the component horizontally and vertically.

Once you defined a placement rule, keep it consistent throughout the app.
