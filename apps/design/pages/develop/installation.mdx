Wanda is a complete design system wich provides all the tools you need to design and develop digital products, from Figma libraries to shared configurations and components.

While some of the developing tools like [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) are mandatory to work with Wanda's UI components, others are **strongly recommended** to ensure consistency and elevetad code quality across projects.

## Installation

Wanda's core elements are formed by [tokens](/develop/design-tokens/), [react-components](https://github.com/wonderflow-bv/react-components) and the [shared configurations](https://github.com/wonderflow-bv/config/).

```bash
npm install @wonderflow/react-components
npm install -D @wonderflow/config
```

  The <b>@wonderflow/config</b> exposes the required PostCSS configuration which
  you have to use in order to use tokens and CSS utilities from the design
  system. Read the next section for more info.
</Snackbar>

## Configuration

Wanda's components relies on [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) to provide the best DX while writing CSS.

To being able to use tokens and custom utilities like custom media queries provided by the design system there are a couple of steps to follow.

Assuming you have already installed PostCSS on your current stack, the first thing to do is passing Wanda's required plugins to it, you can do so by importing `postcssConfig` from `@wonderflow/config` inside your local **postcss.config.js** file.

```js
const { postcssConfig } = require("@wonderflow/config");
module.exports = postcssConfig;
```

### Usage with other plugins

If you're already using other PostCSS plugins you can combine them with the ones required by Wanda. If you declare a plugin which is already used by Wanda you'll overwrite it.

```js
const { postcssConfig } = require("@wonderflow/config");

module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    ...postcssConfig.plugins,
    tailwindcss: {},
  },
};
```

### Importing themes

Then inside your app entry point you have to import two required css files, one is the core styles and other is a theme file which contains all the theme keys used by components and that you can use inside your custom css.

```js
import "@wonderflow/react-components/core.css";
import "@wonderflow/react-components/themes.css";
```

## Recommended tools

To ensure elvetated code standards and consistency Wanda provides also a set of sharable configurations for eslint and stylelint.

### Stylelint

The [stylelint sharable configuration](https://github.com/wonderflow-bv/stylelint-config-wonderflow) provides a set of rules and plugin useful to write and validate your css code. For example, you can get an alert if you miswrite a token or a theme variable.

```bash
npm install -D stylelint @wonderflow/stylelint-config
```

Then add the following code inside your `.stylelintrc.json` configuration file.

```json
{
  "extends": "@wonderflow/stylelint-config",
  "ignoreFiles": [
    "!**/*.css",
    "**/*.jsx",
    "**/*.tsx",
    "**/*.ts",
    "node_modules"
  ]
}
```

### Eslint

The [eslint sharable configuration](https://github.com/wonderflow-bv/eslint-config-wonderflow) provides a set of rules and plugin useful to write and validate your javascript and jsx code. For example, you can get an alert if you write unaccessible html or if you miss an attribute to improve performances.

```bash
npm install -D eslint @wonderflow/eslint-config
```

Then add the following code inside your `.eslintrc.json` configuration file.

```json
{
  "extends": "@wonderflow/eslint-config"
}
```

#### Typescript

To add typescript support to eslint you can extend the configuration by installing [the parser and the plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin).

```bash
npm install -D @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
```

```json
{
  "extends": "@wonderflow/eslint-config",
  "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  "plugins": ["@typescript-eslint"]
}
```

Then create a `tsconfig.eslint.json` at the project root that extends your typescript configuration:

```json
{
  "extends": "./tsconfig.json"
}
```
