Wanda's components use internally [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/docs/) to do animations and transitions. Sometime, when you want to run exiting animations when a component is unmounted you need to use a provider which delay the component unmounting until the exiting animation is completed.

For this purpose, we exposed the `Presence` component, which is a wrapped version of `AnimatePresence` from Framer Motion to which you can pass [any property allowed](https://www.framer.com/docs/animate-presence/#props) by it. Read more about `AnimatePresence` on the [official documentation](https://www.framer.com/docs/animate-presence/).

## Anatomy

```tsx highlight=1,4
import { Presence } from "@wonderflow/react-components";

export default () => (
  <Presence initial={false}>{visible && ...}</Presence>
);
```

    `Presence` is a wrapper of framer-motion's `AnimatePresence` which you can
    use in specific case without installing it. If you're already using
    `framer-motion` in you project you can use `AnimatePresence` directly.
